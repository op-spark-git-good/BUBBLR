# BUBBLR

Welcome to Bubblr! At Bubblr there are a ton of drinks to browse or save for later. If you're feeling creative you can create your own drinks. You can always come back an edit your saved collections, and check out what your friends are liking! Plan a route for bar-hopping so you can meetup with friends! Keep track of your favorite drinks and liquors or wines that you own, or leave comments and reviews for drink that you've tried. You can even play games and keep track of your hangovers if you've partied too hard!
